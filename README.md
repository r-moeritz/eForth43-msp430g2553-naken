# eForth

eForth for the TI MSP430G2553 chip.  One of the few processors still
available in the breadboard friendy 20 Pin DIL Package.  eForth and
application will run ON this chip.

## Contributions

430eForth43n1 ( eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.asm )

is 430eForth43 with the following extensions/modifications:

  * two tiny (hidden) Flash Tools added (`FSCAN` and `QFLASH`)
  * `LITERAL` and `ALIGNED` revealed (made visible)
  * `ERASE` and `WRITE` renamed to `IERASE` and `IWRITE` (because of a name conflict)

`FSCAN` Scans the Flash on COLD start and makes CP point to the start
of the unused Flash area. So 430eForth43n1 behaves like a Forth in RAM
until the Flash is full. Only then you have to re-flash.

`QFLASH` Aborts compilation with message "?flash" when the flash is
full (CP >= $FFC0)

### FlashTools43n1.efs

Source code file to be included in a newly flashed 430eForth43n1. Adds
the words `SAVE`, `RESET` and `MARKER`.

`SAVE ( -- )` Saves the current eForth state to the `COLD` start data.

`RESET ( -- )` Erases the Flash Memory, resets the user variables and
the reset vector and restarts eForth.

`MARKER ( <name> -- )` Creates a word <name>. When <name> is executed
it erases itself and all later defined words from the dictionary,
updates the user variables and executes `SAVE`.

## Assembling eForth

Open a command prompt window. Change to the directory where your
source code is. Type:

    naken_asm -l -o eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.hex eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.asm

Have fun, mk

## Try it out directly

It is easy to program eForth into the TI MSP430 Launchpad. Get the
[mspdebug tool](https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug) and type:

    mspdebug rf2500 "prog eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.hex"

Do not forget RESET after programming.

Then start your favourite Terminal program and start writing short
examples, like in
https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/en:projects:a-start-with-forth:start0
and there probably chapter 11c as a good starting point.

## Start with Forth

- Quickstart: Connect to eForth on your Launchpad using a terminal emulator.  
Compile and save demo forth application: blink.4th.
eForth is CASE SENSITIVE : Type all Forth words in uppercase.

- New to Forth?  
https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/en:projects:a-start-with-forth:start0  
There are various Forth systems mentioned, but the handling is the same.

- New to the TI LaunchPad?  
https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/projects:4e4th:start  
That is for another Forth, but the handling is the same.

- New to eForth?  
Read the included eForth_Overview.pdf to understand eforth.

## Verification

```
430eforth.a43  
Reading Code File ........................... done  
Code size = 0x1058 ( 4184 ) bytes

eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.hex  
Reading Code File ........................... done
Code size = 0x10B8 ( 4280 ) bytes
```

The eForth431-msp430g2553-naken.hex image differs from the original
430eforth.a43 file. A code-block had to be put to an end position, 2
bugs fixed, tiny tools added. Original eForth `WORDS` are the same. See:
screenshots of old (CCS) and new (naken) version.  WORDS .S and some
compiling are ok.

## Why Version 4.3.1 ?

430eForth43 (n) has the serious shortcoming of the reset
trap. Curious, be it beginners or professionals, quickly fall in
without suspecting what's going on there. They usually do not know
anything about

    ' HI APP!
    
Their experience: again a software that does not work properly.  Or
worse, keep away from Forth. :-( Therefore, there is the version 43n1
without reset trap. You can work with it like with Forth in RAM until
the flash is full. Then there is the error message "? Flash". The
interpreter still works, but compiling is no longer possible, again
the error message. You have to re-flash.  Otherwise, 43n1 behaves like
43 (n), so also fits to Jürgen's books and will also work fully with
the IDE as described.

Those interested should use the newer version 43n1.

## To Do

Discard input stream if an error occurs.
